My main purpose for this application is to utilize it primarily for DevOps purposes. However, it makes the most practical sense to build a simple app that represents real world applications.

Therefore, I'll have two directories, `ui` and `api` , both which will be containerized separately eventually. I'll update this README.md as I go along. If the full stack application itself becomes interesting, I can always make it more complex.

## 🖼️ Ui

> NextJS 15 TypeScript app with TailwindCSS & Axios for simple interaction with the API.

Eventually I'd like to use https://qr.io/api-documentation and create a better UX.

1. `cd ui`
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run dev` which opens the ui via Turbopack at `http://localhost:3000`
